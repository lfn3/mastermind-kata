# mastermind-kata

Mastermind scoring with mixed Clojure/Java. This is probably only useful as an example.

Actual scoring is done with Java (I'm trying to brush up.) while tests and specs are in Clojure.
Java methods are wrapped so specs can be written.

Decided to do this because of a [Cognitect blog post](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/10/5/interactive-development-with-clojurespec).
